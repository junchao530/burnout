control:

general summary:

The action of sending a command to the motor and following it's movement to match the desired one using error variables. 

An input is given to the motor and an output(error variable) is recorded from the motor. If the error variable doesn't match the desired speed/input then 

the goal of the control system is for the difference between the desired value and the error variable to be zero.

Ros has a controll libary in which you could develop your own controller with your own logic or use some that are already implemented 
(sudo apt-get install ros*controller*) run this command incase any cocntrollers are missing/cannot be found

the controller consists of two parts the first being the control logic and the second part is the hardware interface which is responsible for connecting the controller logic with the robotics hardware

There are three main types of default controllers called actuators :
1. Position- imagine the link of an arm and the position you want it to be in
2. Velocity- what will be primarily used and it's for controlling the speed of motors
3. Effort- the force required to hold/let go of objects with the correct amount of force.


Yaml files:
for the sake of modularity, since every single robots have different components, yaml files are used so that it can the package can be utilized for different roboots.
