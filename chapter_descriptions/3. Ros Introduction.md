Ros Introdcution:

Goes more indpeth as to why one should use Ros

And teaches how to create a new ROS environment.

Steps to create a new ROS WS:

1. mkdir name_ws
2. cd name_ws
3. mkdir src
4. cd src/
5. catkin_make
# notes that packages at the end you only add whats needed and can add more later
6. catkin_create_pkg name_examples roscpp rospy std_msgs
# do this alot will fix a lot of problems
7. source devel/setup.bash
   
Packages/files created with comments:
1. learn_ws
2. src
3. car_core
4. nodes
5. simple_publisher.cpp
6. simple_publisher.py
7. simple_subscriber.cpp
8. simple_subscriber.py
9. CMakeLists.txt


Important:
during this chapter we create a publisher and subscriber in cpp/python. These are the differences:

publisher:
* component/node that sends messages to a specific topic in ROS netowrk
* Creates specific message types and publishes them
* responsible for initiating, communication and sending data to the topic
* multiple publishers can publish mesages to the same topic
* sends at a certain rate wheneer new data becomes avaialable
* doesn't actively recieve message has to be called

Subscriber:
* recieves mesages from a topic with the ROS netowrk
* listens to a topic and waits for messages to be published to the topic
* requires a call back function which is executed when new message arrives to topic and does the reqiured actions to said data
* multiple subscribers can be subscribed to the same topic 

tldr publishers initiate and send messages while subscribers recieves and processes the data
