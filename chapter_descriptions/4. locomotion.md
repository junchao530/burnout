Importanat Notes:

Ros Parameter server:

A temporary server which can be used to store/access data globally from all nodes which can be very efficient for data transfer. 

Unified Robotics Description Format(URDF):
XML based format which describes the physical properties, kinematics and dynamics of a robot

Here are some important elements of a robot:

* Robot-the root element which encapsulates the entire robot
* Link- the rigit body of a robots strucutre
* Joint- defines the connection between two links allowing for movement between them- notable paramters: revolute, prismatic, continuous, fixedge
* Inertial- specifices the mass, center of mass and intertia of a link
* visual- describes visual apperence usually using stl files
* collison- represents the collision geometry of a link using physics simulatin
  * for collision an important property is origin which has attributes xyz and rpy xyz specifies the translation and rpy is for the rotation around the axis
* transmission- defines the transmissino force and motion between joints including the type of transmission
* sensor- allows for specifications of sensors such as cameras and range finder
* Materials- specifices the visual and collision material properties including coor texutre and physical properties such as friction and restitution
* limit- specifies  the limit on the joint of motion 
* Plugin: Enables the attachment custom plugins or controllers for controlling the robot device

Launch files:
In general running a ros program requires tons of nodes/packages to be called so a launch file can be made to do it all at once. 

A launch file is an xml file used to luanch multiple nodes and configure their parameters

elements:
* launch- root element of a launch file which all are enclosed in
* node- specifies a ros node can appear multiple times to launch multiple nodes
  * Attributes: 
  * name
  * pkg-ros pkg which stores the node
  * type- the type of node 
  * args- optional arguements to be passed
* param- sets a paramter value for the parameter server
  * Attributes:
  * name
  * value- value assigned to parameter
  * type- data type of parameter 
* rosparam- loades parameters from a YAML file into ROS parameter server
  * file- file path to the yaml fiel
* include- include and launches another launch file within the same launch file
  * file - file path to the other launch file
* group- creates a group of node and other launch elements that can be organized and managed together 
  * ns: specifies the namespace
* remap- allows for remapping of a topic and service name within the launch file
* arg- declares an arugment that can be passed to the launch fiel from the command line
  * Attributes:
    * name
    * default
* env sets up enviroment varibles within the launch file
  * Attributes:
  * name
  * value
